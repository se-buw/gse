# 2. Installation (already completed in Eclipse Modeling Tools -- Skip this part!)

Install *EMF* via the **Help** \> **Install New Software...​** menu entry in Eclipse. Select *Modeling* and install *EMF - Eclipse Modeling Framework SDK*. and the *Ecore Diagram Editor (SDK)*. The second entry allows you to create models based on class diagrams.
